  "description": "The proposed project is a first-person perspective labyrinth puzzle game using HTML canvas to draw trapezoids representing walls, floor, and ceiling. The dungeon will be grid-based, and the player will navigate through it by moving from tile to adjacent traversable tile using the arrow keys. The fill style of the left and right trapezoids will dynamically toggle based on the world state - whether there is a wall or an opening. There will not actually be any 3D rendering of anything in this project.",
